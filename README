Here is going to be project about Ribo-seq ncORF in cancer cell lines that can be found in HLA peptidomics. 

In data/:
Files with AUG-predicted ORFs: 

AUG_dORF_1000_10studies.zip
AUG_doORF_1000_10studies.csv
AUG_lncORF_1000_10studies.zip
AUG_nORF_1000_10studies.zip
AUG_uORF_1000_10studies.csv
AUG_uoORF_1000_10studies.csv

File with selected ncORFs: 
ncORFs_with_global_coo.txt

File with ncORF-encoded peptides containing HLA peptides:
peptides_found_in_ncORFs.txt 

File with HLA peptides: 
Novels_forAlla.txt 

Remaning files are subcodon ribo-seq profiles for transcrips with selected ncORFs.
